# RobotMapViewer

This project contains an SFML window which renders a texture to the screen which is an accurate representation of the robot's environment. The application retrieves the robot's sensor data from an excel spreadsheet and translate this data onto a 2D texture. This map is generated in realtime as the robot software (VREP/CoppeliaSim) is currently running.
